# Tor Network Website Hosting Project

## Overview
This repository contains resources and documentation related to a project that explores the fundamentals of hosting a website as a hidden service on the Tor network using Amazon Web Services (AWS) EC2. This simple website is accessible via a .onion domain through the Tor browser and serves as a practical exploration into basic web hosting, server management, and anonymous communication technologies.

## Access the Website
The website can be accessed using the Tor browser at the following .onion address: 
[myl3qbzzngac77vjiiqwfxbzbz7w2xcvcy5uxqvebs2x2traeublopid.onion](http://myl3qbzzngac77vjiiqwfxbzbz7w2xcvcy5uxqvebs2x2traeublopid.onion)

## Project Details

### Objectives
- Gain hands-on experience in setting up and managing an Ubuntu Server on AWS EC2.
- Install and configure Tor to expose a locally hosted website as a hidden service.
- Understand and apply basic network security principles.
- Navigate the intricacies of server management and Tor configurations.

### Technologies Used
- **AWS EC2**: For hosting the Ubuntu server and managing SSH connections.
- **Tor**: For enabling anonymous communication and hosting on the darknet.
- **Ubuntu Server**: As the server OS, providing a platform to host the website.

### Steps Involved
1. **Server Setup & Management**: Provision and manage an Ubuntu Server on AWS EC2.
2. **Install and Configure Tor**: Set up Tor and expose the website as a hidden service.
3. **Website Deployment**: Ensure the website is accessible and functional via a .onion domain.
